# Newton Fractals

Small college project visualizing [Newton fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal). The fractals are created by applying [Netwon's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to various polynomials (shown in top left). 

Based on the initial guess (which is determined by the mouse position), Newton's method will converge to a root seemingly at random. But if one assigns a root-specific color to each root and colors each initial guess based on the root it converges to, a fractal pattern emerges.
